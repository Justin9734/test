Steve definition: behavior and beliefs; created and changed by people. It takes time to changeChanged through subtle behaviors ‚Äî described as ‚Äòcoming in the back door‚Äô ‚Äî learned, passed on, to the point where they become normalized - thus becomes part of cultureNormalization can create harmful patterns (ie sexism)Steve ‚Äòresolution‚Äô: check in with himself about things that feel good versus not as goodIn New School: last month starting to pick up on things that are rubbing him the wrong way. One, banter or trash talking of peers that isn‚Äôt meant to be malicious, but are open to interpretation (shut the back door on this pattern of trash talking). Two, bad language, swearing, hearing it too much. Becoming too normalized, yucky, doesn‚Äôt feel good.
